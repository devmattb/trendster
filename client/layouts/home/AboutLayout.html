                  <p style="font-size: 2vmin" class="flow-text">

                      Trendster.Site was created because of the increasing need of minimalistic and professional-looking websites for up-and-rising public profiles in the world.
                      We believe that anyone who excels in their profession or hobby should be able to have their own website - whether it be athletes, gamers, comedians or hobbyists.
                      <br><br>
                      In the society we live in today, influencers on social media can inspire and motivate others. They can even make people laugh on a daily basis through their pictures, expressions or videos.
                      There is no reason for these influencers to stay at their current exposure level. We want to help them all expand, by making it easier to create and manage a website
                      with sharp design and high-tech features. We want more people to laugh, get inspired, and be motivated through all of these influencers.
                      <br><br>
                      The best part is that we provide this platform, that help influencers increase their exposure, with no initial costs at all. This enables influencers who have a dream to
                      provide for themselves through what they truly love, and the followers that love that very same thing with them, to keep enjoying eachothers help, inspiration and laughter - together.
